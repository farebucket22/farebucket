        <h2>CANCELLATION POLICY</h2>
        <p>
            The cancellation charges depend on the airline, sector, class booking, and time of cancellation. To know what’s applicable in the users case, check the fare rules mentioned on the booking page when users are making your reservation (in case users missed it then, users can always go back to their farebucket account and check out your trips pages). With farebucket, users can cancel your flight no later than 3 hours before the time of departure. If it’s later than 3 hours, users need to contact the airline directly for cancellation. Cancellation can be initiated through My trips or Login page of farebucket. After logging in, the booking can be selected from the upcoming trips and selected for cancellation.

        <h2>REFUND POLICY</h2>
        <p>
            REDDY TRIP will credit the money back to the same account users used while making the booking. For example, if users used your credit card, we will make an appropriate charge reversal. If users used their debit card, we will credit the money back to the debit card. REDDY TRIP usually process the refund within 4 working days of cancellation. However, it may take slightly longer to reflect in the users account statement depending upon their bank. We’ve noticed that it takes about 14 working days for most refunds to hit their respective accounts.
