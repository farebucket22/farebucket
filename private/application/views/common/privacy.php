		<h2>UNREGISTERED USERS</h2>
		<p>	
			We encourage you to register with us in order to book services on our website and to take advantage of our customized features. 
			If you do not register, then the information we collect from you is limited. We log your IP address in order to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Web site and track usage statistics. If you reached our site by clicking on a link or advertisement on another site, then we also log that information. This helps us to maximize our Internet exposure, and to understand the interests of our users. All of this information is collected and used only in the aggregate; that is, it is entered into our database, where we can use it to generate overall reports on our visitors, but not reports about individual visitors.
			We also place a “cookie” on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie may contain information that allows us to track your path through our Web site and to determine whether you have visited us before. However, unless you register with us, it contains no personally identifiable information that would allow us to identify you. Cookies cannot be used to read data off of your hard drive, and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by other Web sites. We use cookies in this manner to help us understand how visitors use our site, and to help us to improve our site. You may refuse to accept a cookie from us by following the procedures specific to your Web browser. Although you may do so, you may find that your browser reacts strangely when visiting not only our Web site, but other Web sites as well. Since cookies don’t provide us with any information from which we can identify you, we suggest you allow us to place one on your computer.
			We do not store your credit / debit card numbers or credit / debit card information nor do we store your bank account information with us. Your credit / debit card transaction or Internet banking transaction is carried out at the payment gateway which is owned by the respective bank.

		<h2>REGISTERED USERS</h2>
		<p>	
			If you register with us, we will collect personal information from you in addition to the non-personal information described above. That personal information may include your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, travel preferences, passport number, user name and password. The information we collect may vary, but we only collect the information that you manually enter into our forms. We may store all or some of that information in a cookie file on your hard drive, so that our system will recognize you each time you visit our site. In that way, we can save your preferences from visit to visit and present you with a customized Web site, without requiring you to log into our site every time you visit. To improve services and enhance personalization, we may periodically obtain information about you from other independent third-party sources and add it to your registration information.
			We do not store your credit / debit card numbers or credit / debit card information nor do we store your bank account information with us. Your credit / debit card transaction or Internet banking transaction is carried out at the payment gateway which is owned by the respective bank.

		<h2>PRODUCTS OR PURCHASES MADE IN FAVOR OF THIRD PARTY</h2>
		<p>When you purchase products or services for a third party using your ID and password, we will collect that third party’s name and contact information, and other information as required by the travel service provider(s), so that we can complete the booking.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="modal-section">
		<h2>USAGE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED BY US</h2>
		<p>As mentioned above, registering with us allows you to personalize our Web site so that it is useful to you. It also allows you to log into our site automatically each time you visit, rather than manually typing your user name and password every time. By registering you can also track your history of transactions that you have done on our site. We may also use this information to periodically contact you with news, special offers, notifications or important information or to request your feedback on our site. </p>

		<h2>DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
		<p>
			REDDY TRIP does not sell or rent any personal information to any third party. We may aggregate personal information from all of our users and provide that information in the aggregate to other parties, including advertisers, for marketing and promotional purposes. However, if we do so, that information will not be in a form that will allow any third party to identify you personally.
			We may share your personal information with third-parties specifically engaged by REDDY TRIP to provide services such as Airlines, Hotels, Ground Handlers, Service organizers, Insurance Companies, Product Companies and advertising agencies, in which case we will require those parties to agree to use any such personally-identifiable data solely for the purpose of providing the specified services to you. We may also use the information to provide to government agencies like RBI, Banks etc as per the laws of the country. 
			REDDY TRIP cooperates with legal authorities, and may in some circumstances be required to disclose personally identifiable information in response to requests from law enforcement authorities, or in response to a subpoena or other legal process.

		<h2>PROTECTION OF OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
		<p>REDDY TRIP has implemented security procedures to help protect the personal information stored in our systems. For example, we limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information. We also employ security processes (such as password hashing, login auditing, and idle session termination) to protect against unauthorized access to your personal information.</p>

	<div class="modal-section">
		<h2>THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS AND LINKS</h2>
		<p>Third parties advertise on our website. We do not share any Personal Information about you with these advertisers unless you give us permission to do so, separate from any permission you provide during the registration process. When you click on one of these advertisers’ links, you are leaving our site and entering another site. We are not responsible for such third party’s sites. You should carefully review the privacy statements of any other site you visit, because those privacy statements will apply to your visit to that site, and may be very different from our policy.</p>

	<div class="modal-section">
		<h2>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
		<p>REDDY TRIP reserves the right to change this policy should we deem it necessary to do so and the user accepts the changes so made (in the event of personal details already provided) and waives intimation of the changes.</p>
